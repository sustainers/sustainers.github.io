On 16th June 2023, the yearly [Sustain Africa](https://festival.oscafrica.org/sustain-africa) event (a satellite event using the Sustain brand) happened in Lagos, Nigeria, bringing OSS contributors and maintainers from different countries in Africa. [Open Source Community Africa](https://oscafrica.org), a community of open-source enthusiasts, advocates, and experts within and across Africa, hosted the event. This year, they had seven (7) working groups, including:

* Open Source Software Development
* Open Source Documentation
* Open Source Design
* Open Source Data Science
* Open Source Marketing and Funding
* Open Source Programs and Specialized Projects
* Open Source Burnout and Mental Health

The conversation around the comprehensive overview of how FOSS is developed, maintained, utilized, and providing a roadmap for solving the cultural, financial, and institutional issues among open-source project maintainers continues to be the focus of Sustain. Kindly read the [community report](https://blog.oscafrica.org/sustain-africa-2023-community-report) to learn more about the outputs of the summit.
