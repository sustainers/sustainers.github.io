After [some discussion](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/dropping-twitter/1417) on the Discourse, we have decided to entirely stop using X, formerly called Twitter, as a social venue for Sustain. So, from now on, we have formally paused using it.

You can still find Sustain here:

* [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@sustainoss)
* [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/sustainoss.bsky.social)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18941143/)
* [Discourse](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/)

See you around!
