## Short Version

SustainOSS is dedicated to creating and maintaining welcoming, inclusive, safe, and harassment-free spaces to talk about open source sustainability. Anyone participating in our spaces, digital or physical, will be subject to and agrees to sign on to our Code of Conduct described below.

## Long version

The primary goal of SustainOSS is to create and maintain spaces that are safe, inclusive, and welcoming to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible, in order to talk about open source sustainability. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of employer, license of preference, perspectives on sustainability, political views, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our spaces, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.


## Scope

All attendees, organisers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers participating in or around our physical events, along with users and administrators of our digital spaces, such as on GitHub, our working group video calls, or the Discourse forum, are required to abide by the code of conduct.

The organisers and administrators will enforce this code at all times. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everyone.


### Expected Behaviour

We expect participants to:

**Be welcoming, friendly and patient**

Our community is increasingly diverse, we frequently welcome participants who are new to conversations that may have been discussed for some time, and we welcome those who are new to the idea of open source software or work in adjacent communities like design, documentation and research.

**Be respectful and considerate**

The subjects that we touch on can be polarising, but that is no excuse for poor behaviour or manners. We allow others the consideration that we would appreciate ourselves, and we do not allow our frustrations to turn into personal attacks. We appreciate that many members of our community are communicating in a second or third language. We agree that a community in which members feel uncomfortable impacts our ability to work together and have productive conversations.

**Be mindful of the words that you choose**

Be kind to others, in whatever medium you communicate (words, images, videos, references, etc.), by paying particular attention to the degree to which intent can be misinterpreted when communicating in writing. We do not insult, put down, harass or exclude others. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Exhibiting sexually explicit or violent speak or material.
* Publishing (or threatening to publish) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Recording, photographing or filming other persons without their consent. Seek consent before recording. Also ask people who may be seen or heard in the background. Similarly, don't publish private communication without asking first, except if the communication was unwanted (harassment, threats etc). If in doubt, you can ask us before publishing something.
* Personal insults.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Unwelcome unsolicited advice.
* _Ad hominem_ attacks.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
* Repeated harassment of others.

In general, if someone asks you to stop: stop.

**Take an empathetic approach to resolving disagreement**

We foster a philosophy of collaboration over conflict, but we appreciate that conflicts can and will happen. When they do we resolve differing views constructively, seeking to understand the other’s point of view before expressing our own. If another participant is unwilling to continue the discussion we allow them the time and space they need and gain permission before engaging again. Remember that we all share a common goal, to sustain open source software, and that our different perspectives and experiences make us stronger as a community. Equally, if we are unable to understand another’s point of view it doesn’t mean that they are wrong.

**Look after one another**

We are a growing community, and while organisers and administrators do their best to mediate, mitigate and otherwise maintain our spaces as safe, inclusive and welcoming places to participate, we are not everywhere at all times. If you see concerning behaviour, we expect you to report it. This is especially important for our in-person events: if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or witness a violation of this code of conduct report it immediately to an organiser (they will make themselves known at the beginning of events and will be clearly identifiable throughout) or administrator.


### Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify an organiser or administrator as soon as possible. Organisers will make themselves known at the beginning of in-person events and can be identified by their badges. Our digital spaces are administered by:

- Richard Littauer (he/him): [richard@sustainoss.org](mailto:richard@sustainoss.org)
- Pia Mancini (she/her): [pia@sustainoss.org](mailto:pia@sustainoss.org)
- Eriol Fox (they/their): [eriol@sustainoss.org](mailto:eriol@sustainoss.org)

You can contact all of us by emailing: [coc@sustainoss.org](mailto:coc@sustainoss.org).

Organisers and administrators will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the physical events.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any participant, including sponsors, organisers and administrators, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply _immediately_.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, organisers and administrators will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, limiting their access to spaces or excluding them entirely from events and spaces without warning and without refund.
