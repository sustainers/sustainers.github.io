## Travel Support

The organizers are arranging a travel support fund for those who would otherwise be unable to attend sustain in San Francisco on 19th June.  Travel support will cover the costs of ground and air transportation, accommodation and meals along with the cost of a ticket. 

SustainOSS is all about supporting open source maintainers. We want to hear from maintainers with a deep understanding of the issues and from those who have tested ideas to improve their own projects. With that in mind the organizers will prioritize support for those with experience of maintaining or sustaining and open source project. 

Applications are open until Friday 26th May. Submission of an application DOES NOT guarantee approval. Please do not make reservations until your application has been approved. We will notify you of approval by Friday 2nd June 2017.
