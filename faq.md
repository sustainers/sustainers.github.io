## What is $ustain?

A one-day event, were we'll talk about how to sustain open source software. It's not a large conference with talks and keynotes, and it's **not** an unconference; it's a gather of open source contributors, maintainers, and sustainers; industry leaders and people interested in open source; and friends. The goal is to understand the long term viability of open source as a model for producing software.

## How is it written? (Sustain OSS, $ustainoss, $ustainOSS, $ustain OSS)

$ustain is the name of the event. The organization is $ustainOSS but SustainOSS or `@SustainOSS` will do.

## How many people will be there?

We expect to have somewhere around 50 people. We'd like to have more. Why don't you [sign up](https://opencollective.com/sustainoss/events/2017)?

## What is the price?

The regular price is $50. This goes towards day care, travel assistance, food, and unforeseen costs. We'd appreciate if you paid $100 and allowed someone else to come; if you can't pay $50, there is also a free tier. Finally, if you're a [sponsor](https://sustainoss.org/sponsor/), a [$1,000 ticket is available](https://opencollective.com/sustainoss/events/2017#sponsor), and we'd feature your logo on the website and mention you at the conference as a sponsor. Everybody wins. Also note that all profits (if any) go back to the Open Source community via Open Collective or Gratipay. Projects TBD.

## Will you have discounts for students?

If you are a student you can grab a free ticket while supply lasts. If you can afford a ticket, please consider purchasing one incase a student who can't afford it can come.

## What will you be serving for lunch?

Yes. More TBA.

## Will there be talks?

No talks. Instead, we hired a facilitator, [Gunner](https://aspirationtech.org/about/people/gunner), from [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org/) to come and help us have a roundtable discussion, where everyone can feel included.

## How many days is it?

1 day.

## Will there be hotel accommodations?

Not at this time. We aren't a huge event so getting something like this is highly unlikely. If you are looking to save on stay, we recommend [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/San-Francisco--CA).

## Will there be other events in different countries?

This is the first! We'd love to have other events elsewhere - perhaps you'd like to host one?

## Do you accept in-kind sponsorships?

Get in touch - these will be thought over on a case-by-case basis.

## When will I receive a ticket?

You should receive a receipt immediately on donating. This can be used at the door.

## What other events can you compare $ustain to?

This event is very similar to the [Wontfix Cabal](https://maintainerati.org/) organized at GitHub in February 15. It's also similar to a few other recent events - [OSFeels](http://www.osfeels.com/), for instance.
