## What is $ustainOSS?

A one-day conference and discussion, were we'll talk about how to sustain open source software. It's not a large conference with talks and keynotes, and it's not an unconference; it's a gather of open source contributors, maintainers, and sustainers; industry leaders and people interested in open source; and friends. The goal is to understand the long term viability of open source as a model for producing software.

## How is it written? (Sustain OSS, $ustainoss, $ustainOSS, $ustain OSS)

SustainOSS is fine. But anything really works.

## How many people will be there?

We expect to have somewhere around 50 people. We'd like to have more. Why don't you sign up?

## What is the price?

The regular price is $50. This goes towards the venue, running costs, food, and to the costs of organizing it. We'd appreciate if you paid $100 and allowed someone else to come; if you can't pay $50, there is also a free tier. Finally, if you're a sponsor, a $1000 ticket is available, and we'd feature your logo on the website and mention you at the conference as a sponsor. Everybody wins.

## Will you have discounts for students?

We hope so! Keep your eyes peeled; we're working on getting sponsorships for studnets.

## What will you be serving for lunch?

More on this later. We'll cater to vegetarians; paleo eaters may have to go hunting and gathering during the afternoon sessions.

## Will there be talks?

Yes and no. People will talk, but the event is purposefully unstructured. Instead, we're investing in community organizers to come and help us have a roundtable discussion, where everyone can feel included.

## How many days is it?

1 day.

## Will there be hotel accomadations?

This currently isn't planned. If you would like to hotel recommendations, get in touch.

## Will there be other events in different countries?

This is the first! We'd love to have other events elsewhere - perhaps you'd like to host one?

## Do you accept in-kind sponsorships?

Get in touch - these will be thought over on a case-by-case basis.

## When will I receive a ticket?

You should receive a receipt immediately on donating. This can be used at the door. There's no ticket in the mail that you have to bring - this is 2017. We're doing OK.

## What other events can you compare $ustain OSS to?

This event is very similar to the [Wontfix Cabal](https://maintainerati.org/) organized at GitHub in February 15. It's also similar to a few other recent events - [OSFeels](http://www.osfeels.com/), for instance.
