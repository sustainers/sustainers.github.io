**How to get involved**: This WG has wound down. However, if you'd like to participate more, go comment [in the Discourse discussion thread](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/principles-of-authentic-participation-continuing-the-sustain-conversation/284).

## Purpose

To define a core set of principles of what _authentic participation_ means in multiple contexts (e.g. corporate, individual, humanitarian/NGO, etc.).

## Goals

* Explore what Authentic Participation means from different perspectives
* Write a draft of these Principles and release in the commons
* Take a final draft and act as advocates for these Principles in our organizations, projects, and communities
* _Optional_: Continue participation as curators of Principles over time

## Guiding questions

1. What does organizational accountability mean?
   What does it look like in practice?
1. How does an organization participate in open source communities transparently and authentically?
1. How can we create a shared, inter-organizational resource to take back to our orgs to help explain what authentic participating in open source actually looks like?
1. How can we build social accountability into our workplaces?

## Reports and documents

This discussion took place across two working sessions at Sustain 2020:

* Models for corporate accountability as open source community members (a.k.a. what does it mean to be a corporate member of open source communities?)
