title: Personas on Sustainability
slug: personas

**Status**: Incubating<br>
**Bottom liner**: Jacob Redding<br>
**How to get involved**: See section below.

## Purpose

To identify the different personas within Open Source. Who are the consumers, producers, providers, sponsors, or *fill in the blank* of Open Source? What are the sustaining efforts for each of these members of the ecosystem?

## Goals

1. Identify attributes of what sustainability means to us
2. Determine the personas

## Guiding questions

To help guide the conversation to our goal of identifying key personas within an open source project we asked ourselves the following questions:

1. What are the various attributes of a well maintained open source project?

    This was one of the first questions we asked ourselves and worked to identify both attributes and anti-patterns (items that threatened the attribute of sustainability). The list below was just a small part of a short brainstorming session and is not comprehensive - it's the result of a handful of dedicated folks coming together for a few minutes.

    A few of the attributes we defined include:

    | Attribute | anti-pattern |
    | --------- | ------------ |
    | Resilience |   |
    | quantity/group (redundancy) | Burnout |
    | growth pathway | Lack of counsel (legal or organization) |
    | Succession planning | lack of recruiting/marketing/onboarding |
    | mentoring/training | economy |
    | Good Docs | Regulation|
    | resources (time/talent/treasure, fit into society, alignment with use     cases, alignment with scale | lack of tooling |

    <br>

2. What does sustainability mean for a single project vs. and entire ecosystem?
3. How do resources get into open source (time, talent, treasure)?
4. Does it fit into society?
5. What stage is it in?
6. How is it used?
7. What are anti-attributes or things that impede sustainability?

    * Burnout
    * lack of users
    * lack of legal council/organizational support
    * world economics
    * regulation (export laws, legal restrictions)

## Reports and documents

Who are the personas?

| Persona | Description | Sustainability attributes |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Developers | writing code | No burnt out, succession plan for replacement |
| Advisors |  in-house legal, lawyers | |
| Enablers |  CTOs, CFOs, VCs, funders, mid-mgmt  | |
| OSS Community |  contributors, FTE contributors, community managers, event planners, maintainers, mentors, reviewers, hobbyists, developers, reviewers  | |
| Direction setters |  BDFL, Product Lead, innovators, OEMs  | |
|  Community agnostic|  end users, corporate users, career devs, governments  | |

|     | End Users | Community Members | Enablers | Direction Setters |
| --- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------| ----------------- |
|Examples   | Corporate Users, Career Developers (non-OSS contributors), Governments, Academics | Contributors, reviewers, organizers, core devs, hobbyists, writers, documentarians, designers, and more | CTOS, VCs, Funders | Foundations, Product Owner, Project owner (BDFL), Innovators|
|Definition | Software users potentially unaware of OSS | Very aware of OSS & involved| Money, time, Time/talent/treasure | Risk taker, Thinkers/tinkerers |
|Sustainability attributes| Marketing, functionality, great products, SaaS, Product Sales, Service Sales | GSOC/Hacktober, Outreach, camps/confs, employment agreements (contracts), Gitcoin, Open collective | Risk/Reward ($$$), results/metrics, cost savings (time/money) | Risk/Reward, freedom of time, creativity, challenge to solve|

When people talk about sustainability outside of OSS, itâ€™s often called a business model. There are different levels of sustainability based on the scale of the ecosystem in question.

## How to get involved

Currently this group is not meeting regularly to update the personas, but we would all be delighted to collaborate further on this topic. If this is of interest to you, feel free to reach out to me (Jacob Redding) and I will help to coordinate how to bring your thoughts and ideas to life in this area.
