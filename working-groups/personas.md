**How to get involved**:

## Purpose
To identify the different personas within Open Source. Who are the consumers, producers, providers, sponsors, or *fill in the blank* of Open Source? What the sustaining efforts for each of these members of the ecosystem? 

## Goals
1. Identify attributes of what sustainability means to us
2. Determine the personas

## Guiding questions
A single definition of a persona is difficult. To help guide the conversation we asked ourselves a few foundation questions: 

1. What are the various attributes of a well maintained open source project?  
A few of the attributes we defined include: 
- Resilience
- quantity/group (redundancy)
- growth pathway
- succession
- training/mentoring
- good docs
- resources (time, talent, treasure)
- good tooling

2. What does sustainability mean for a single project vs. and entire ecosystem?

3. How do resources get into open source (time, talent, treasure)?
4. Does it fit into society? 
5. What stage is it in? 
6. How is it used?

7. What are anti-attributes or things that impede sustainability?
- Burnout
- lack of users
- lack of legal council/organizational support
- world economics
- regulation (export laws, rescriction)

## Reports and documents
Who are the personas? 

| Persona | Description | Sustainability attributes |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Developers | writing code | No burnt out, succession plan for replacement |
| Advisors |  in-house legal, lawyers | |
| Enablers |  CTOs, CFOs, VCs, funders, mid-mgmt  | |
| OSS Community |  contributors, FTE contributors, community managers, event planners, maintainers, mentors, reviewers, hobbyists, developers, reviewers  | |
| Direction setters |  BDFL, Product Lead, innovators, OEMs  | |
|  Community agnostic|  end users, corporate users, career devs, governments  | |

When people talk about sustainability outside of OSS, itâ€™s often called a business model. There are different levels of sustainability based on the scale of the ecosystem in question.
