## Purpose

Help the open source ecosystem navigate and recover from COVID-19!

## Goals

* Build a tool where open source projects and people working on open source can request money, get help, and generally work together to get through COVID-19.

## Resources

This is a very active working group. Our main work takes place on the [Open Collective Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com/#fossresponders).

Our main deliverable so far is a website: <https://fossresponders.com/>. We've also managed to raise over $115k for various open source companies, so far.

## How to get involved

Join us on the Slack channel! We also have weekly Thursday calls. Get in touch.
