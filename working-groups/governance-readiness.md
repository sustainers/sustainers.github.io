**Further details**: This working group has concluded. You can view details about it [in the Discourse discussion thread](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/governance-readiness-working-group/298)

## Purpose

To define a methodology to identify and deploy healthy governance models.

## Goals

The main goal of the working group has initially been described as:

* Create a checklist to verify whether open source projects _are ready_ to deploy some kind of governance (or to change their current governance for a healthy one).

You can visit the checklist website [here](https://sustainers.github.io/governance-readiness/).

Other complementary goals are:

* Identification of analysis dimensions in open source projects. It may be needed for the assessment of the current status of the project.
* List of possible governance models (or most used / recommended)
* Recommendations/fixes to make your project governance-ready

## Guiding questions

* What do you understand by "governance readiness"? (e.g., ability to be governed, things to change to enable a specific governance models, etc.)
* What do you understand by "governance checklist"? Do we aim at creating an actual checklist?
* What should be the actual focus? (e.g., identifying governance models, proposing a change in the model, checking that an OSS project is well governed, etc.)
* Should we focus on specific topics? (e.g., community, methodology, etc.)
* What is the most immediate step to take? short-term? long-term?
* How do you see your contribution to this group?
