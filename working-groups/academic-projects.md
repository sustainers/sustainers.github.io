## Purpose

* To connect universities and other academic research institutions to collaborate on how to approach and work on open source together.

## Goals

* To build an ecosystem map of the space so that we know who is doing relevant work and how to get involved
* To connect people working in universities, both in and outside of OSPOs
* To enable collaboration around shared effort in academia

## Guiding questions

* What does it mean for open source to be part of academia?
* What is the role of OSPOs in academia? What does a post-OSPO world look like?
* How do students, researchers, civil society members, and institutions work together effectively for open source?
* What is the wider role around research software engineers, and how can we support them as part of the open source ecosystem?

## Reports, documents, and resources

* An [ecosystem map](https://sustainers.github.io/academic-map/intro.html) is being made to outline the space as a whole.
