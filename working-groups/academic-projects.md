**How to get involved**:

- Email Richard at richard at sustainoss.org

## Purpose

- To connect universities and other academic research institutions to collaborate on how to approach and work on open source together.

## Goals

- To build an ecosystem map of the space so that we know who is doing relevant work and how to get involved
- To connect people working in universities, both in and outside of OSPOs
- To enable collaboration around shared effort in academia

## Guiding questions

- What does it mean for open source to be part of academia? 
- What is the role of OSPOs in academia? What does a post-OSPO world look like?
- How do students, researchers, civil society members, and institutions work together effectively for open source?
- What is the wider role around research software engineers, and how can we support them as part of the open source ecosystem?

## Reports and documents

TBD.

## Resources
