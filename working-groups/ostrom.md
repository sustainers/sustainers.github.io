## Purpose

Developing the Principles of Open Source Commons Governance

## Goals

* First and foremost, I'd like to revise this 'Principles of Open Source Community Design' document into a shareable artifact. Both the principles and the 'questions to ask frequently' in application of the principles. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLjzRT9u-vjswnVj4AVYtmI8-eYkQPszigkYEkzcH-k/edit>

* One of the primary new insights to come out of the sessions was a proposal to develop that framework into a matrix that applies the principles to a set of layers of types of resources. I'm into it! But it's a new direction and we won't have had as many eyes on the product. And I'm not sure how to format it.

* Lastly, I'd like to see us align this with other work, both with other workgroups -- especially 'Governance readiness,' maybe also 'membership models' -- and other similar projects people shared with us like this - <https://inno3.frama.io/tutoriel-communs-numeriques/>

## Guiding questions

How should [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLjzRT9u-vjswnVj4AVYtmI8-eYkQPszigkYEkzcH-k/edit) to be useful?

How might the Principles be clearer and more appropriate?

How can we facilitate the application of those principles to various aspects of open source communities? i.e. through a matrix of 'Questions to Ask Frequently' for each 'layer' of an open source commons?

How should the document be formatted for sharing as a useful artifact?
