## Purpose

## Goals

- First and foremost, I'd like to revise this 'Principles of Open Source Community Design' document into a shareable artifact. Both the principles and the 'questions to ask frequently' in application of the principles.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLjzRT9u-vjswnVj4AVYtmI8-eYkQPszigkYEkzcH-k/edit

- One of the primary new insights to come out of the sessions was a proposal to develop that framework into a matrix that applies the principles to a set of layers of types of resources. I'm into it! But it's a new direction and we won't have had as many eyes on the product. And i'm not sure how to format it.

- Lastly, I'd like to see us align this with other work, both with other workgroups -- especially 'Governance readiness,' maybe also 'membership models' -- and other similar projects people shared with us like this -[ https://inno3.frama.io/tutoriel-communs-numeriques/
