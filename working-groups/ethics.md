## Purpose

To bring an ethical perspective to FOSS projects, in the what we create, and the way we treat staff and contributors.

## Goals

* Create guidelines for creating Ethics boards
* Help facilitate labor organizing
* To normalize ethics as part of development
* Lowering barriers for ethics in terms of legal and technology
* Help create or facilitate tooling and education

## Guiding questions

* What does it mean to work ethically in open source?
* How can ethics and a free and open source license coexist?
* What does ethical enforcement and regulation look like?
* How can we do the most moral good while also making open source software?

## Deliverables

We have a podcast, which we make together with the Ethical Source group.  [Listen here](https://anchor.fm/ethicsinopensource).

## How to get involved

For now, this group is meeting irregularly. To get involved and to help bootstrap efforts, your best bet is to get in touch with either [Chris Chinchilla](https://chrischinchilla.com/) or [Richard Littauer](https://twitter.com/richlitt), or to post on [the Sustain Discourse](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/).
