## Purpose

What motivates contributors? How can we work together to help them stay motivated? And what does ethical business or project management look like, in this context?

## Goals

- An essay or report on how to help motivate contributors
- A survey of tools or best practices

## Guiding questions

- How can we motivate contributors? Is this needed?
- What are the best ways for projects to incentivize contributions?
- How does a project turn a drive-by contributor into a maintainer?

## Reports and documents

At the moment, we only have some brief notes from the Sustain meeting in January.

## How to get involved

Email Richard. Right now, he is the bottleneck. A second meeting will occur before the end of April.
