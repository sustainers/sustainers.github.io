* Organising events and programs that help open source communities and members understand DEI principles and best practices.
* Collaborating with organizations championing DEI to create and curate resources and reference guides. 

## Guiding questions

* What does DEI mean to you? How do you approach DEI within your Community? Do you focus only on users, contributors, or both?
* How can we support DEI efforts in FOSS communities?
* How can we sustain the DEI within the open source?

## Reports, documents, and resources

We do not have any of these currently available. However, we do have notes from Sustain Summit unconference discussions. As well, reports and educative documents will eventually be created as we progress.

## Suggestions welcome

We aim to collaborate with existing projects that are already championing DEI efforts by providing additional support, driving more awareness, contributions, promotion, or other forms of assistance. All questions, suggestions, feedback, or partnership ideas are invaluable to our mission. Together, we can make a meaningful difference.
