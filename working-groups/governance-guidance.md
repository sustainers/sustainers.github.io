## Purpose

To create resources to facilitate creating of governance models in Open Source projects.

## Goals

Our goals include the elaboration on principles on governance, the definition of a matrix of questions to ask frequently (joining ideas from previous WGs), etc.

## Guiding questions

* How can we guide developers to create efficient governance models?
* Which principles drive the definition of governance models in your project?
* Which dimensions should you consider when eliciting governance models?
* How can you efficiently address governance in recently created projects?

## Reports and documents

You will find the reports and documents in this section. Right now, these are a work in progress. Join the group to help make them.

## Resources

Take a look at the [Governance Readiness](https://sustainoss.org/working-groups/governance-readiness/) and [Ostrom](https://sustainoss.org/working-groups/ostrom/) working groups for resources being drawn specifically into this one.
