## Purpose

To create resources to facilitate the elicitation of governance models in Open Source projects.

## Goals

Our goals include the elaboration on principles on governance, the definition of a matrix of questions to ask frequently (joining ideas from previous WGs), etc.

## Guiding questions

* How can we guide developers to create efficient governance models?
* Which principles drive the definition of governance models in your project?
* Which dimensions should you consider when elicitating governance models?
* How can you efficiently address governance in recently created projects?

## Reports and documents

You will find the reports and documents in this section.

## Resources

Other resources will be included here.
