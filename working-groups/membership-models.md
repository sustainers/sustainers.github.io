## Goals

Discuss different models of membership specifically for orgs developing
FLOSS. Maybe communicate via de forum or slack (in a specific channel
for this) and maybe meet every month or so via voice.

> *What are your desired outcomes?*

It would be great to get a document/page/something with different
possible models with pros/cons and examples in the real world :)
