# Agenda

‚ÄúSustain‚Äù will be a one day conversation for open source software sustainers.
There will be no keynotes, expo halls, or talks. Only discussions and ideas
about getting and distributing money or in-kind services to the Open Source
community. We will be building the outcomes and agenda of the day together
with the sustainers that will be participating. The agenda can (or not)
look like this:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover table-striped table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Time</th>
        <th>Activity</th>

        <td><strong>Opening Session</strong> <hr> The event will be called to order with a friendly and fast-paced kickoff that includes words of welcome from hosts and co-organizers, brief participant introductions, along with overviews of the agenda, participation guidelines and meeting logistics.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9:30am</td>
        <td><strong>Interactive Plenary</strong> <hr> This session will provide a highly collaborative opportunity for participants to share their views on issues relevant to the meeting topic and goals, and weigh in on related topics.</td>

        <td><strong>Break</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10:45pm</td>
        <td><strong>Agenda Hacking</strong> <hr> Working on large-group and small-group formats, participants will engage and discuss "big picture" issues relating to the agenda and goals for the meeting, and brainstorm specific topics to be revisited in both subsequent sessions and post-event collaboration. The goal of the session will be to generate a visualization of issues and open questions relevant to the meeting, and enable participants to weigh on which topics are most promising for focus and further discussion in the course of the agenda.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>11:15am</td>
        <td><strong>Collaborative Working Sessions</strong> <hr> These breakout sessions will invite participants to explore and share knowledge on topics identified in pre-event engagement and planning. Session facilitators will briefly introduce the objective of each session, and participants may then elect to join the session of their choice. Report-backs will be done at the end of the session slot. <br><br> Based on pre-event input from participants, sessions anticipated to be on the agenda include:
<ul>
<li>Session 1</li>
<li>Session 2</li>
</ul>
