# Agenda

“Sustain” will be a one day conversation for open source software sustainers.
There will be no keynotes, expo halls, or talks. Only discussions and ideas
about getting and distributing money or in-kind services to the Open Source
community. We will be building the outcomes and agenda of the day together
with the sustainers that will be participating. The agenda can (or not)
look like this:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover table-striped table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Time</th>
        <th>Activity</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>09:00am - 09:30am</td>
        <td>Name badges</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>09:30am - 09:50am</td>
        <td>Caffeine &amp; Snacks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10:00am - 11:00am</td>
        <td>Standup (what would you like to accomplish today)</td>
      </tr>
