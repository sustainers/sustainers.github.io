      <p>Sustain is, at its ❤️, a group of people who work together to figure out how we can sustainably improve the open source ecosystem. While we don't have strict rules - we're a community, not a company! - we do have some best practices, which, over time, have grown to make it easier for us to work with each other and with new members.</p>

      <p>This list is not exhaustive! But it is an attempt at showing newcomers how they can best engage, and for showing how we, as the long-standing members of Sustain, have managed to work together easily.</p>

      <p>Not seeing something on this list? Add it! You can open a Pull Request at <a href="https://github.com/sustainers/sustainers.github.io">the website repo</a>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We listen more than we speak. If we're talking a lot, we're probably missing something.</li>
        <li>We accept that we can always improve, without shaming or blaming anyone, including ourselves.</li>
        <li>We do not merge PRs without review. If someone opens a PR on the website, they wait for someone else to merge it.</li>
      </ul>
