<h2 class="text-center mb-4 tealdark">About Sustain</h2>

It all started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jdorfman/status/801558965423222784) in November 2016. Six months later, one hundred people gathered in San Francisco and created a cultural shift in how we
think about the sustainability of open source software.

After the event, a [report](/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf) was written and a definition
was born, "_sustainerâ€”the individual or organization who is concerned with the fragile state and future
of highly-used and impactful open source projects_". If that sounds like something you identify with,
you should join us.

Sustain events are led by a facilitator. There are no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos. Undivided attention is required. Phones and laptops are put away throughout the day.

What this means is that Sustain is a different sort of conference, and that participants are fully engaged. Since 2017, the Sustain community has held events around the globe. As well as events, Sustain also hosts a semi-weekly podcast, and facilitates working groups getting into the weeds of what sustainability means.

Join us!


<h2 class="text-center mb-4 tealdark">Organizers</h2>

Sustain is open source, and anyone can join. However, there tends to be a core group involved in organizing the events and work.
