    <h2 class="text-center mb-4 tealdark">About Sustain</h2>

    <p>It all started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/jdorfman/status/801558965423222784" target="_blank">tweet</a> in November 2016. Six months later, one hundred people gathered in San Francisco and created a cultural shift in how we
    think about the sustainability of open source software.</p>

    <p>After the event, a <a href="/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> was written and a definition
    was born, <i>"sustainerâ€”the individual or organization who is concerned with the fragile state and future
    of highly-used and impactful open source projects"</i>. If that sounds like something you identify with,
    you should join us.</p>

    <p>Sustain events are led by a facilitator. There are no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos. Undivided attention is required. Phones and laptops are put away throughout the day.</p>

    <p>What this means is that Sustain is a different sort of conference, and that participants are fully engaged. Since 2017, the Sustain community has held events around the globe. As well as events, Sustain also hosts a semi-weekly podcast, and facilitates working groups getting into the weeds of what sustainability means.</p>

    <p>Join us!</p>


    <h2 class="text-center mb-4 tealdark">Organizers</h2>

    <p>Sustain is open source, and anyone can join. However, there tends to be a core group involved in organizing the events and work.</p>
