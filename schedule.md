# Schedule

<p class="text-muted">25th of October, Pullman St. Pancras Hotel London.</p>

<h2 id="draft-agenda" class="my-3">Draft Agenda</h2>

The following is a preliminary schedule for the Sustain Summit 2018.

The event will be structured as a day of collaborative working sessions, along with optional evening activities. Participants are encouraged to organize additional evening fun.

The agenda is being designed as a combination of planned sessions and participant-driven discussions, and specific topics will be placed into time slots based on input at the meeting from those who will be in attendance. Sessions will be dialog- and outcome-oriented rather than presentations or lecture format.

The program is envisioned to enable deeper collaborations and learnings across the global network of open source leaders and stakeholders in order to collectively improve our skills, strategies and impact in our respective sustainability efforts.

The following are some general guidelines regarding how we'll run the event:

* **The agenda is malleable.** Sessions will be proposed and moved around to accommodate requests by both participants and facilitators. All break times are approximate.
* **Many session topics and outcomes are being sourced from pre-event input from participants.** We welcome additional session proposals, as long as they are not lecture or slideware-based and they focus on collaboration and sharing of experiences.
* **If there is a listed session or discussion you would like to help facilitate**, feel free to be in touch with the organizers in advance; we'd love to hear what you're thinking. We will also be reaching out to participants based on their specific inputs and experiences, and inviting you to help out with particular sessions that have been proposed.
* **Full participation in the program is expected**; part-time participation will work against the overall event goals. In particular, we ask all participants to refrain from scheduling side meetings during scheduled agenda times. We ask that each participant utilize their seat at the meeting to the fullest for the benefit of all.
* **This is a "devices at ease" event:** use of laptops and cellphones during sessions is strongly discouraged unless you are a designated note taker. We encourage all participants to be fully present in sessions and discussions, rather than multitasking on email etc. We invite participants to use the morning and afternoon breaks, as well as the lunch hour, to check in with external realities.
* This is a **"no pitches event"**. We are here to talk about sustaining our community and not to recruit users or sell your project.
* **Notes** will be dynamically captured during sessions. We will be asking each participant to help capture notes in at least one session, so as to spread the work around evenly.

Sessions are designed to be highly interactive. This isn't the place where you will see any panels and keynote speakers. Breakout sessions will be designed to spur discussion. Facilitators understand that their primary goal is to enable learning, address questions, and support peer sharing. Bring your questions, and your knowledge to share!
