[Sustain](https://podcast.sustainoss.org/) brings together practitioners, sustainers, funders, researchers and maintainers of the open source ecosystem. We have conversations about the health and sustainability of the open source community. We learn about the ins and outs of what ‘open source’ entails in the real world. Open source means so much more than a license; we're interested in talking about how to make sure that the culture of open source continues, grows, and ultimately, sustains itself.

[S.O.S. Design](https://sosdesign.sustainoss.org/) is a podcast dedicated to exploring the intersection of open source and design: how design is crucial in the open source ecosystem, how designers work with coders to make open source software better, and what sustainability means for the field of open source designers. This podcast grew out of the Sustain community and Open Source Design, and seeks to share great conversations with members from both communities and the open source and design space at large.

[OSS for Climate](https://ossforclimate.sustainoss.org/). The climate crisis is the most important challenge facing humanity. We need better ways to help us diagnose and understand the problem, and to build technology in our struggle to preserve the natural stability and resources of this planet for future generations. The open source movement is one answer - it is the key to bringing trusted knowledge, technology and collective action together.

We tell stories of open source coders and makers working on collective, community code projects as part of our struggle to preserve the livelihood of our planet. Listen in!

[The CHAOSS Community podcast](https://podcast.chaoss.community/) features members who spent considerable time and effort to understand open source community health and how we can measure it through metrics, analytics, and software. We invite guests to this podcast to talk about how they use open source community health metrics and software in their own open source communities, companies, or foundations. This podcast fills the gap with open source community metric definitions and software on one side and their use on the other side.

[Let's Talk Docs](https://ltd-podcast.sustainoss.org/)! On this podcast, we’ll be sharing with you a new concept around documentation and sustainability. We’re going to talk about how you can leverage documentation, how you can leverage content to bring more people, more attention, and more funding to your products. We’ll talk to experts who know how to write content engagingly, interview people who speak about the importance of content having goals, and talk to people who have successfully built projects, used excellent documentation, and used the content as the pillar of their success.
